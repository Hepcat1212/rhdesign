            <p><span class="firstcharacter">F</span> or the kickoff of a 6 month pilot exploration into a block of time on Friday for BB&T Digital Services employees to learn, create, and explore. The company needed a logo to capture the spirit of the initiative. Part of my own “Innovation Time Friday” was to draw on my own instense love of vector artwork and branding. Every Friday for four hours, the design team dedicated themseles to projects that would help them grow. This included motion graphics projects, React coding modules, and vector artwork pursuits. Using the corporate palaette and some fresh ideas I began the journey to create a league of my own.</p>

            <p class="para-header">THE PROBLEM: </p>
            <p> Originally dubbed Innovation Time, I needed to come up with something that was fresh and modern that got people excited about pursuing and learning to sharpen their vocation. I started out exploring the idea of time in a new way that would convey the idea that coud be looked at as a legit brand. My first inclination was to start sketching out ideas so that is where I started.

            <p>I always wanted to create a pennant like sports flag for a logo and happy that this gave me the opportunity to do so.  The tower part was perfect to create two symetrical flags that filled the space of the bulb. All colors were expermented with inside the BB&T palettee.  I need a smooth futuristic font that complimented the roundness of the artwork. That is where magistral came in. I used a gradient inside the bulb to create the glow effect and added one lighting bolt above the flag and tower. All in all it was a successful a great logo to design and one of my favorites to date. Seeing your logo come alive using the brand and reinventing a new look for a group of very talented people was a real joy. Giveing the autonomy and space to create makes all the difference when creating something. I guess that embodies the true spirit of the innovation league.
