            <p><span class="firstcharacter">G</span> ravitate started from may years of traveling with across much of the American west, Hawaii,  		     and most recently the Bahamas. I have studied, worked, in several cities so far in my life. Getting around in new and foreign places by yourself can be frightening but taps into the adventurous spirit that I believe resides in all of us.  Being able to find places that enrich us spiritually, challenge us physically, and exposes us to the leanest part of whom we are I believe makes us grow far past an other venture. Gravitate came from this. Exploring new parts of the world, but most importantly your own backyard creates community or pockets of places we can reside to when we need it the most. </p>

            <p class="para-header">THE PROBLEM: </p>
            <p>What was lacking with most travel apps and itinaries or even apps like yelp, there was very little way to save and use the reviewed items of places that people have been. Your options are limited. It also focused on mory commercially viable places that didn’t necessarily have a foot in the community and weren’t the most original places of business. I wanted to create usable iteneraries that focused firat locally and had a wide range of activities that spoke to people and families of all ages and interests. Whether it was national/state parks, museuems and activities for children, or foodies exploring the local cusine. How could I create a usable app that organizes experiences and centralizes all of interests into one place, plus keeps your palette open to more experiences
            </p>

            <p class="para-header">THE PROCESS: </p>
            <p> I wanted to make interface as accessible as possible and very eay to use. THe idea is simple, I want to be able to quickly search for cities, countries, and experiences within my dashboard and quickly review those experience so I can add them to my bucket list. Once they are in my bucket list I can orgnazie them into usable itenaries that can be put in motion when I arrive in the area I want to explore.
            </p>

            <p> So where do I start. Dashboard, dashboard, dashboard. Creating an experience that focuses on three things. Recent tripes in your feed related to your interests, your active buckets, and your itneraries.  A user be greeted by all the new stories in thier dasshboard that are related to theri interests. In addition they would see thier top bucketlists and their itineraries that were created by thier bucket lists.

            <p class="para-header">THE SOLUTION: </p>
            <p> As much as the vector watches were a fun and necessary exploration, I decided to explore channging the name of the group. The company really liked the idea of the name innovation. So I could not change that. But I wanted to create smething fun, sportish, and exclusive that embodies all of the things that the spirt of innovation involves. The word League, kept bouncing around because even as adults we needgroup like this to escape to, support us, and allow us to be playful with others and our ideas.  I like the word league enough to go down the rabbit hole and started sketching out flags. Innovation was is tied to light bulbs that I almost needed to go with that, but wanted it to be backdrop to the overall composition of the logo and not be the prime mechanism of the association. I liked the idea of drawing bulb as the outline of the logo and the prime focus to be inside the bulb using the conduit prongs as a tower as well as serving as a flag pole. Adding to the flair were lighting bolts bringing an edginess to the work and a themeatic tone of the electrical synapsis that accompanies gread ideas and learning.

            </div>


            <p>I always wanted to create a pennant like sports flag for a logo and happy that this gave me the opportunity to do so.  The tower part was perfect to create two symetrical flags that filled the space of the bulb. All colors were expermented with inside the BB&T palettee.  I need a smooth futuristic font that complimented the roundness of the artwork. That is where magistral came in. I used a gradient inside the bulb to create the glow effect and added one lighting bolt above the flag and tower. All in all it was a successful a great logo to design and one of my favorites to date. Seeing your logo come alive using the brand and reinventing a new look for a group of very talented people was a real joy. Giveing the autonomy and space to create makes all the difference when creating something. I guess that embodies the true spirit of the innovation league.
